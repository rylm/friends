## It's time to make a change
Crypto can be brutal for new users. It's a good thing we love it and want to make it more accessible! With Friends wallet powered by passkeys, account abstraction, and AI, it's easier than ever to dive into web3.
## Main problems with existing wallets
- The onboarding process takes a lot of clicks
- You need to have different tokens to pay for gas
- It's scary to do anything beyond sending/receiving tokens, requires an understanding of smart contract logic
- Overwhelming amount of technical details
## Our solution
- Using passkeys to create a wallet and sign transactions, there is no need to ever see a seedphrase again!
- Using account abstraction to sponsor transactions, forget about directly paying for each transaction's gas!
- Using AI to explain complicated on-chain logic in a user-friendly way, never get lost trying to wrap your head around a contract!
## Technology
- Implemented a mobile wallet that supports ERC-4337: Account abstraction
- Implemented a custom validator smart contract (0xF944D221736518F4438C618c9f571b3B5d9fdB0F on Fuji Testnet) to sign user operations with passkeys
- Currently working on ChatGPT integration to provide explanations for smart contracts and transactions
- Currently working on a smart contract to share tokens via a link
